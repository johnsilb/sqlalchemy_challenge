# sqlalchemy_challenge

# After performing some basic SQLAlchemy tasks I moved the data to a pandas dataframe.
#       I first read the data into a dictionary and converted the dictionary into a dataframe
# This created some problems with data types and extra characters.
# Removing the extraneous characters caused the variables to become objects, requiring another change.
# I was then able to sort the dataframe on the date and find the most recent date,
# and from there I was able to calculate the date from 1 year before and sort the data.
# Working with the data in a data frame was not optimal and I took the time to work out the 
# SQLAlchemy solution.

# I then used the original dataframe to calcualte the rain mean, median, mode and standard deviation.
